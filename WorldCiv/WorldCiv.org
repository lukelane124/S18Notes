*** Astronomy - Wrote down observations
This allows us to /track/ backwards in time and /line up/ our time line, and understandings with theirs.

*** Mathematics
Mostly derived from needs of scribes, and clerks, doing tax calculations, record keeping was also important.

:DATE: <2018-01-25 Thu>

** Objectives
+ Survey of science, medicine, and technology in Ancient Egypt

+ Begin out exploration of the three subjects, mention above in world cultures

+ Briefly discuss /Time/
  
** Opening Vignette <<Poem>>
I have a Mining region of the sovereign\\
I had gown down to the sea\\
In a board 120 cubits long\\
40 cubits broad\\
in which there were 120 sailors for the choicest of Egypt...\\
before it came they could fortell a gale\\
a storm before it existed\\

From A Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor (Maybe from 2500 BC)

+ Know that person was fairly intelligent. 
  
** Thinking about time
\begin{align
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[./img/egypttln.png]]
- 323 BC Death of Alexander the Great
- 0
- 120 AD Roman Empire at its height

*** Gregorian Calendar
- Introduced in 1582
- Pop Gegory XIII
- Modification of Julian Calendar
  - Julian Calendar introduced by Juluis Ceasar as modification of teh current Roman Calendar, after Rome conquered Egypt
  - 365 Days, with a leap year every four years in February
  - 10 Days were dropped to make the celebrarion of Easter (usually at the Vernal Equinox) with the historical time of celebration in the Early chirstian Church
  - More accurate calculation for leap year*
    -Driggers talks about this at length. Mainly about why we removed the 10 days from the location near Easter.
*** Religious Traditions and Time
- For instance, it's 5776 in teh Jewish Tradition
  - Traditional Lunar-Solar Calendar (follow moon phases + solar year)
  - From their makring of creatio
  - Does not mean taht even Orthodox Jews think that the earth is only about 6,000 years old =(not young each creationist)= ???
- The current Islamic year is 1437 AH. =In the year of HIjra=
  - Hijra (Mohammed flees from Mecca to MEdina; run out by political power of hte city)
  - Lunar Calendar 354 days
  - Starts teh year 622 CE =year of Hijra=
*** Egyptian Calendar
#+attr_html: :width 300px
#+Caption:Egyption Calendar
[[./img/egyptcal.png]]

Broken down, mainly followed the exceptionally regular flooding of the Nile.

[[file:img/egyptcalCivil.png]]

Common Era and AFter Common Era
- *BCE* "Before the common era" used interchangably with B.C or "Before Christ"
- *CE* / *ACE* "Common Era" used interchangably with A.D. =Anno domini, in the year of our Lord=

** Continuation of discussion from earlier [[Poem]]

   What does this "Primary Source" tell us about Egyptian Societ?
   - What's a cubit?
     - Length of measurement, the average man's _forarm_
   - Ships?
     - Not sure what he wanted here...
   - Knowledge that this primary source conveys?
     
   - How does this hvae a bearing on science and technological development?
     Not a clue......
** Background of Ancient Egypt
   [[file:img/ancegyptMap.png]]
   [[file:img/modegyptMap.png]]
  
*** The Nile river (The Life line of egypt)
   [[file:img/modNile.png]]
   [[file:img/ancNile.png]]
   
   - Discussion of the Nile
     - General Information/History about the nile
     - Egypt's and its close relationship with the Nile
     - Religion and the Nile
*** Advanced Plant knowledge
    *Example* Cyperus Papyrus - Essentially paper.
    [[file:img/papyrusPg.png]]
    
*** Agricultieral Success
    - What did egyptions grow to eat
    - And Drink

    - Examples of Food
      - Beer (Barley and Emmer) Driggers says this was used mainly to preserve the landowner's grain; however, this misses a crucial aspect of water preservation. 
	This might not have been a problem for folks in the Nile, but beer was crucial in sailing endeavors.
      - Wine (Grapes) grains preservation.
      - Spices 
	- Garlic, aniseed =the seed of the anise, used in cooking and herbal medicine.=, cinnamon, corriander, cumin, dill, fennel, marjoram, rosemary, and thyme (_BUT NO PEPPER_?)
      - Meats
	- Cattle, Quail, --hens raised for eggs MUCH later; dicks, geese)
      - Fish
	- Caught with net, spears, traps, and hooks /Seems like modern day fishing no????/
      - Veggies
	- beans, cabbage, celery --worst food in world!; chickpeas, peas, onions, lentils
      - Fruits
	- apples, dates, figs, jujubes, olives, pomegranates, melons
      - Sweets/Sweetening Agents
	- Dates, fig, honey

** Egyptians at Sea
#+Caption: Lighthouse of Alexandria: Potentially one of the seven wonders
   [[file:img/7wonderLight.png]]
   No modern peoples are sure if this lighthouse ever really existed.

** Egyptain Civilization and Society (Organization)
   This "layout" is much like fudelism in the mideival period in Europe.

   [[file:img/egyptSoc.png]]
   
   [[file:img/egyptExpsoc.png]]

** Pharaoh
   - Description of Pharaoh
   - Shirtdiscussion of the Expansion fo Egyptian Power
   - Divine Rule
*** Religion (Ra)
    Some scholars would argue that Egypts were monotheists. The argument would be along the lines of Ra was so important all the other gods just faded away.
    Pharaoh was the emodiment of Ra. when PH died Ra would /reincarnate/ as the next PH in line.

    [[file:img/PHegRA.png]]
*** Religious tradition "the book of the dead"
    Didn't disuss the book, as I remember.\\
    Mainly discuessed how when you die your heart is placed on a scale alongside a feather.
