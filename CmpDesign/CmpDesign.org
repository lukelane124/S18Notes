*** VHDL code for DFF.
+ If all inputs are not in the sensitivity list, then the circuit is not combinational.

** DFF with muliplexer
*** TODO grab simulation data from elearn for notes.

** Writing a test bench
+ How is it done?\\
You must test the functionality of the circuit.


** Use componenets and generates.

** Serial Adder

** Synchronous System
+ FF are clocked by the same common clock signal
+ Races and hazards are not a problem in synchronous systems ->WHY?
  + Races: More than 1 signal switching concurrently
  + Hazards: Unwanted switching transients that may appear at the output of a circuit because differnt path exhibits different propagationn delays.
+ *Not* a problem because the clock takes care of the slower of the race condition.

*** Tasks
+ Minimize and determinte the amount of clock skew in the system
+ Ensure that FF have positive setup and hold time margins =Shown in next slide=
+ Identify asynchro......

#+Caption: Detailed timing diagram showing prop delays and setup and hold times w/ respect to clock.


t_ffpd = ff prop delay\\
t_comb = combinational logic delay\\
t_setup = time duration prior to the clock edge at which the incoming data to the flip flop should be stable.\\
t_hold Time duration after the clock edge for data to remain stable.\\

*** So, how fast can I run my adder???
I want my clock period > (t_ffpd + t_comb + t_setup)\\
Also, want to make sure that T_hold > t_ffpd + t_comb
*** clock skew
#+Caption: Clock skew example.
clock_skew = Difference in arrival times of the clock signal to different devices.

**** Solution for clock skew
H-tree clock layout.
